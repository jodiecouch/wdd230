        <p>
          Mr. Espinota, a farmer by trade, came to California in the 1980s to
          manage a farm in Salinas Valley. He fell in love with the beautiful
          landscape and diverse cultures that make up California. In his free
          time he began exploring all that California has to offer. Eventually
          he settled in Carlsbad with his family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through his work in farm management and logistics Mr. Espinota has
          made many friends and aquaintances. It was not uncommon for these
          friends to share seasonal crops and specialty items from the areas
          they were traveling through. In time Mr. Espinota became known as a
          source for the freshest California produce without having to travel
          out of the area.
        </p>

        <div class="odd">

        <p>
          Mr. Espinota soon saw the demand for California fresh foods locally.
          He had also built a vast network of friends and partners in the
          agricultural industry throughout California. Combining these ideas he
          began selling fresh produce in a roadside fruit stand on Sunny Street
          in 1995. That roadside stand grew into what is now Bountiful Foods at
          our Carlsbad location.
        </p>

        <p>
          With an increases in population and food awareness the demand for
          fresh, local and organic produce keeps growing. Recognizing the need
          for more locations throughout the South Coast region Bountiful Foods
          returned to it's roots, the roadside fruit stand. Today we provide
          that roadside fruit stand via five food trucks that serve the area.
          The food trucks allow us to offer our very popular juice bar where
          ever we may go.
        </p>
        <p>
          We look forward to serving you. Bountiful Foods continues to provide
          innovative ways of serving our community and customers. Yesterday,
          today and tomorrow we remain true to our roots with fresh, local,
          organic produce.
