          In 1870s a freight route was established from the railraod in Kelton,
          Utah, headed towards Boise, Idaho and the mining towns in that area.
          This route broute travelers through what is now Albion. Settlers began
          filing for homesteads in the Albion area in 1871.

          The City of Rocks Backcountry Byway weaves through the Albion Mountain
          Range and rural landscapes peppered with towering granite spires.

          The Backcountry Byway Begins in Albion on Idaho highway 77, the byway
          passes by Pomerelle Mountain Resort and Lake Cleveland Recreation Area
          as it heads south. Attracting rock climbers, campers and hikers, the
          City of Rocks National Reserve and the neighboring Castle Rocks State
          Park feature enchanting geologic wonders.
        </p>
        Today Albion has a population of 422 people. Agriculture, mostly
        ranches, fill the valley. However, Albion remains the gateway to the
        Albion Mountains. Mt Harrison is the highest peak at 9,265 feet.
        Pomerelle Ski Resort is only 16 miles from Albion. The City of Rocks is
        29 miles from Albion.

          The Methodist congregation was established in 1878 and the Albion
          Methodist Church was built in 1888-89. It became Albion's first
          institutional building; it remained one of the city's few public
          buildings for much of its early history and hosted other churches'
          services and public meetings. The church remained open through 1951,
        </p>
        <p>
          The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in
          1986. Today the build is Grange Hall #321 and still used a public
          meeting place for the community.
