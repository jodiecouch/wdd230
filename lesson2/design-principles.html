              Capital One has been at the fore-front of great user design.
              Simple is how I would describe Capital One's website and their
              mobile app. They use white space to make things easy to find and
              easy to read. In this example they also use Fitt's Law
              effectively, the continue button almost jumps out at the user. It
              takes effort not to click it.

            <p class="blurb">
              Verizon Wireless uses white space, or negative space well. Really
              key here though is their use of contrast to highlight how they
              want you to feel about their products and services. If you follow
              the link you will see that they captivate the user with contrast
              and motion.

            <p class="blurb">
              StackOverflow is more like software rather than a website that is
              pushing a product or service. StackOverflow isn't pushing you to
              buy anything and their content has a nice usable business type
              software feel to it. Usable is how I would describe their landing
              page. I think Hick's law applies here because when I look at the
              page there is one button. It is the most colorful and it is right
              at the top. It feels as if there is only one choice, to ask a
              question.
